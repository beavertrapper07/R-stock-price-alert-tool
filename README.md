# R-stock-price-alert-tool
R script that alerts you via email when a certain stock leaves a price channel

I wanted to closely watch some of the stocks in my portfolio, but didn't want to pay for one of the services that alerts you given your criteria. The free services only let you place alerts on a few stocks, at best. This R script allows me to buy a stock, and then set alerts for instances of the closing price falling below or above my tolerances (y, z in the function).
